* The ideal size for a mobile hero image is 800 x 1,200 pixels / 16:9 aspect ratio.

* For a banner hero image, the ideal size is 1600 x 500 pixels.

* You want to compress your hero image if you have a large file size (anything over 1MB is too big). You can use sites like TinyJPG, Compress JPG, or Adobe's Photoshop Compressor to decrease the size without reducing quality. Just make sure to get the dimensions right beforehand or the image may appear blurred or stretched.

* The main things to keep in mind are:
    * The hero image needs to be centered.
    * The text needs to be easy to read.
    * It has to look great on all screen sizes.
    * The image should cover the entire viewport.
